# DelaunayTriangulation

Code to compute the Delaunay Triangulation of points on regular (integer) grid. The triangulation is 'edge-based'; Input is list of points (space-seperated integer pairs) and output is list of edges (space-seperated integers quadrplets) making up the triangulation. Written in C.
